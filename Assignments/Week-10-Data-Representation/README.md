## Second assignment - Bike data visualization
There is a service of bike rental within the city. Out of the accesible public information a demo is built in which data is represented
on the map. In this case the data is the chosen top number of used routes within the city in different periods of time.

Initially at 10, it will mean that the top ten routes are shown for the given period of time (either the whole of 2021 or some months of 
2022).
